Holberton sys-admin repo
This is a public repo.  I understand the preference was for the repo to be private.  However, my initial request for the GitHub Student Pack was rejected.  My second request is curretly listed as "pending".  A message to GitHub support has not yet gotten a reply.  My plan is to make future repos private.
